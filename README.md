# Advent of Code Clock (aoc-clock)

# Introduction
I thought it would be fun to put together a seven-segment terminal clock based on a 2021 AoC problem. 

I found the problem particulary fun and nostalgic. Defining the rules for decoding the segment digits reminded me of codecracking books I read as a child. My AoC solution for that day can be found on my Github [here](https://github.com/AlexanderWebster/advent-of-code-2021/tree/main/day-08-seven-segment-search).

I kept the format of the clock and its segments "true" to the original with one exception - you can optionally style the segments with the â–ˆ character. I felt that this gave the digits of the clock a neat retro-future, [Stanley Kubrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick_filmography)-esque look.

You can also enable periodic randomization of the ascii characters representing the segments, just like the Aoc problem.

See [Advent of Code - Day 08](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8) for this project's inspiration :)

## Use aoc-clock
### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderWebster/advent-of-code-clock.git
cd advent-of-code-clock
npm i
```
### Examples
```bash
# Default
node aoc-clock

# 12hr format, displays seconds
node aoc-clock -f 12 -p seconds

# 24hr format, displays seconds 
# Scrambles segment chars periodically
node aoc-clock -f 12 -p seconds -r

# Display seconds, scramble segment chars
# Specify segment colors and enable 'Kubrick' styling
node aoc-clock -p seconds -r -c white,magenta -k
```
### Usage
```
Usage: aoc-clock [options]

Options:
  -r, --rand              Randomizes the ascii chars assigned to each segment periodically (default: false)
  -f, --format <type>     Display 24 or 12 hour format (default: "24")
  -p, --precision <type>  Display seconds or minutes precision (default: "minutes")
  -c, --color <type>      Specify two Chalk.js colors for dots,digits (default: "grey,red")
  -k, --kubrick           Display clock in Kubrick style
  -h, --help              display help for command
  ```

## On Customization
All text coloring is done with the [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) library. You can find all available colors there. Note: I would have preferred to use [Picocolors](https://github.com/alexeyraspopov/picocolors) for the speed/size benefits, but at the time of this writing, they do not appear to support retrieving and applying colors dynamically.

You can stack 'Kubrick'-mode and Chalk's backgound colors to achieve a neat visually styled clock.
